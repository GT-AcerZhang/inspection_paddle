## Description
In the textile industry, long defects like the skipping stitch severely postpone the manufactory pipeline and cost lots of cloth waste. This project is aimed to build up an object detection algorithm which could perform a real-time fabric defect detection on a portable device (for example, the Jetson Nano). The algorithm would deliver a >99% recall rate with the false alarm rate less than 1%. Make sure to optimize the algorithm to be portable and compatible enough to fit the terminal's computiing power.
